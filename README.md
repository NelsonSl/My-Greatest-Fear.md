# **My Greatest Fear by Nelson**

 I do not get a good grade in school by just a little bit and I just fall out of the admission average needed fpor the course
 From there I dissapoint my parents and they disown me
 Also being embarassed is pretty bad
 So another fear I have is being embarassed in front of everyone I know and in front of strangers thats bad too
